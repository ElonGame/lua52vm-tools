Preface
-------

I wrote this because writing out something is the only way I can
get to understand it for myself.  It's aimed at readers who think
they know the Lua 5.2 Reference Manual (LRM5.2) pretty well, have 
a little experience with the machine instructions of at least one 
machine (Knuth's `MIX` will do) and would like to do some tinkering 
with code for the Lua 5.2 Virtual Machine (VM5.2).

**Thanks:** I've borrowed a lot from Elijah Frederickson's site 
<https://github.com/mlnlover11/LuaAssemblyTools> (LAT), which not
only has a set of assembly tools for Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.2, but also
a fairly complete collection of useful earlier stuff by other people,
in particular, Kein-Hong Man's _A No-Frills Introduction to Lua 5.1 
VM Instructions_ (NFI), which despite being written for Lua 5.1 is 
still extremely useful. And of course, sooner or later you will feel 
compelled to read the very condensed but absolutely definitive comments 
in the Lua 5.2 source code, particularly `lopcodes.h` and `lundump.c`.

Binary chunks
-------------

> A chunk can be stored in a file or in a string inside the host
> program. To execute a chunk, Lua first precompiles the chunk into
> instructions for a virtual machine, and then it executes the compiled
> code with an interpreter for the virtual machine. 
>
> Chunks can also be precompiled into binary form; see program `luac`
> for details. Programs in source and compiled forms are
> interchangeable; Lua automatically detects the file type and acts
> accordingly.  — §3.3.2

The first paragraph above is the only one in in LRM5.2  containing 
the phrase "virtual machine".  Three standard library functions deal 
with binary chunks: `load`, `loadfile` and `string.dump`. That is as 
much as the user is allowed to see officially. In closed-source code
that would be as much as the user would ever know.

But Lua is open-source. Not only is the source code well commented: we
are allowed to reverse-engineer. Let us try `luac` first.

    $ luac
    luac: no input files given
    usage: luac [options] [filenames]
    Available options are:
      -l       list (use -l -l for full listing)
      -o name  output to file 'name' (default is "luac.out")
      -p       parse only
      -s       strip debug information
      -v       show version information
      --       stop handling options
      -        stop handling options and process stdin

Right, we will give it a Hello World program, slightly convoluted
to make it interesting.  After the second line, terminal input stops 
(I typed Control-D) and `luac` printout starts.

    $ luac -l -l -v -s -
    Lua 5.2.1  Copyright (C) 1994-2012 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
    local hello = "Hello"
    print (hello.." World!")
    
    main <stdin:0,0> (7 instructions at 0x9984970)
    0+ params, 4 slots, 1 upvalue, 1 local, 3 constants, 0 functions
    	1	[1]	LOADK    	0 -1	; "Hello"
    	2	[2]	GETTABUP 	1 0 -2	; _ENV "print"
    	3	[2]	MOVE     	2 0
    	4	[2]	LOADK    	3 -3	; " World!"
    	5	[2]	CONCAT   	2 2 3
    	6	[2]	CALL     	1 2 1
    	7	[2]	RETURN   	0 1
    constants (3) for 0x9984970:
    	1	"Hello"
    	2	"print"
    	3	" World!"
    locals (1) for 0x9984970:
    	0	hello	2	8
    upvalues (1) for 0x9984970:
    	0	_ENV	1	0

We'll discuss this output later: at this stage all I want you to see 
are four lists: lightly commented assembly code, constants, locals and 
upvalues.

Now we go to Lua itself.  `load` the same chunk, dump it to get
the bytecode, write it to a file. I patched my Lua to give a prompt
of three blanks instead of `>` so that you can just cut-and-paste
this code.

    $ lua
    Lua 5.2.1  Copyright (C) 1994-2012 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
       func = load 'local  hello = "Hello" print (hello.." World!")'
       chunk = string.dump(func)
       io.open("hello.luac","wb"):write(chunk)

`luac` accepts binary chunks too.  We can use it to take a look 
at what `load` did.

~~~
$ luac -l -l -v hello.luac
Lua 5.2.1  Copyright (C) 1994-2012 Lua.org, PUC-Rio

main <(string):0,0> (7 instructions at 0x90d0b50)
0+ params, 4 slots, 1 upvalue, 1 local, 3 constants, 0 functions
	1	[1]	LOADK    	0 -1	; "Hello"
	2	[1]	GETTABUP 	1 0 -2	; _ENV "print"
	3	[1]	MOVE     	2 0
	4	[1]	LOADK    	3 -3	; " World!"
	5	[1]	CONCAT   	2 2 3
	6	[1]	CALL     	1 2 1
	7	[1]	RETURN   	0 1
constants (3) for 0x90d0b50:
	1	"Hello"
	2	"print"
	3	" World!"
locals (1) for 0x90d0b50:
	0	hello	2	8
upvalues (1) for 0x90d0b50:
	0	_ENV	1	0
~~~

Spot the differences? 

- `(string)` vs `stdin`
- `0x90d0b50` vs `0x9984970` in four places
- `[1]` vs `[2]` on all but one of the instructions

I.e. `load` and `luac` basically generate exactly the same code.

Bytecode dissected
------------------

What exactly is in the bytecode?  Here is the hexdump of `hello.luac`
(made by `hd` on my system).

Much of that is for debugging, so pass `hello.luac` through `luac -s` and
try again.

The format is not officially documented, and needs to be reverse-engineered.
The necessary material is in the Lua source code, of course, in several
places, mainly `ldump.c` and `lundump.c`.  I have also cross-checked with
NFI and LAT, but any remaining errors are mine.

The code starts with an 18-byte file header, which is the same for
all official Lua 5.2 bytecode compiled on a machine like yours, whether
by `luac` or `load` or `loadfile`.  Lua 5.1 only had a 12-byte header, 
similar to the first 12 bytes of this one.

Byte numbers are in origin-1 decimal (mostly showing the arithmetic)
and origin-0 hex.

`1 x00: 1b 4c 75 61`
~   `LUA_SIGNATURE` from `lua.h`.
`5 x04: 52  00`
~   Binary-coded decimal 52 for the Lua version, `00` to say the bytecode
    is compatible with the "official" PUC-Rio implementation.
`5+2 x06: 01  04  04  04  08  00`
~   Six system parameters. On x386 machines they mean: little-endian,
    4-byte integers, 4-byte VM instructions, 4-byte `size_t` numbers,
    8-byte Lua numbers, floating-point. These parameters must all 
    match up between the bytecode file and the Lua interpreter, otherwise
    the bytecode is invalid.
`7+6 x0c: 19 93 0d 0a 1a 0a`
~   Present in all bytecode produced by Lua 5.2 from PUC-Rio.
    Described in `lundump.h` as "data to catch conversion errors".
    Might be constructed from binary-coded decimal 1993 (the year it 
    all started), Windows line terminator, MS-DOS text file terminator, 
    Unix line terminator.

After these 18 bytes come the functions defined in the file.  Each
function starts with an 11-byte function header.

`13+6 x12:  00 00 00 00`
~   Line number in source code where chunk starts. 0 for the main chunk.
`19+4 x16:  00 00 00 00`
~   Line number in source code where chunk stops. 0 for the main chunk.
`23+4 x1a:  00  01  04`
~   Number of parameters, vararg flag, number of registers used by 
    this function (not more than 255, obviously).  Local variables
    are stored in registers; there may not be more than 200 of them
    (see `lparser.c`).

Then a list of instructions. We'll do their format in more detail
later.

`27+3 x1d:  07 00 00 00`
~   There are 7 instructions in the list (little-endian byte order, 
    as specified in the file header).  
`30+4*1 x21:  01 00 00 00`
~   Bytecode for `LOADK 0 -1`.
`30+4*2 x25:  46 40 40 00`
~   Bytecode for `GETTABUP 1 0 -2`.
`30+4*3 x29:  80 00 00 00`
~   Bytecode for `MOVE 2 0`.
`30+4*4 x2d:  c1 80 00 00`
~   Bytecode for `LOADK 3 -3`.
`30+4*5 x31:  96 c0 00 01`
~   Bytecode for `CONCAT 2 2 3`.
`30+4*6 x35:  5d 40 00 01` 
~   Bytecode for `CALL 1 2 1`.
`30+4*7 x39:  1f 00 80 00`
~   Bytecode for `RETURN 0 1`.

Next a list of constants.

`58+4 x3d:  03 00 00 00`
~   There are 3 constants.
`62+4 x41:  04`
~   First constant is a string,
`66+1 x42:  06 00 00 00`
~   with 6 bytes in it,
`67+4 x46:  48 65 6c 6c 6f 00 `
~   containing "Hello" and a terminating zero byte. 
`71+6 x4c:  04  06 00 00 00  70 72 69 6e 74 00`
~   Second constant is the 6-byte string "print". 
`77+5+6 x57:  04  08 00 00 00  20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21 00`
~   Third constant is the 8-byte string " World!"

Followed by a list of function prototypes.

`88+5+8 x64:  00 00 00 00`
~   There are no function prototypes. 

Finally followed by a list of upvalues.

`101+4 x68:  01 00 00 00`
~   There is 1 upvalue.
`105+4 x6c:  01 00`
~   It can be found in a stack 1 level up, at position 0 in that stack. 

At this point, the two files differ.  In the stripped version,
the absence of debugging information shows as 16 zero bytes.

`109+2 x6e:  00 00 00 00`
~   There is no source code
`111+4 x72:  00 00 00 00`
~   The list of line numbers is empty
`115+4 x76:  00 00 00 00`
~   The list of local variable names is empty
`119+4 x7a:  00 00 00 00`
~   The list of upvalue names is empty

In the unstripped version, the information is given thus:

`111 x6e:  30 00 00 00`
~   The source code is 48 bytes long. Skipping past the source,
`111+4+48 xa2:  07 00 00 00`
~   There are seven line numbers. Skipping past those numbers,
`163+4+28 xc2:  01 00 00 00`
~   One local variable name is listed. 
`199 xc6:  06 00 00 00  68 65 6c 6c 6f 00`
~   It's `hello`.
`199+4+6 xd0:  01 00 00 00`
~   It comes into scope at instruction 1.
`209+4 xd4:  07 00 00 00`
~   It goes out of scope at instruction 7.
`213+4 xd8:  01 00 00 00`
~   One upvalue name is listed.
`217+4 xdc:  05 00 00 00  5f 45 4e 56 00`
~   It's `_ENV`.

After this, more functions may be encoded in the same way.

That's as far as I go. The following areas have not been covered:

   - How non-string constants are stored.
   - How function prototypes look.

NFI has all that and more, but it's 5.1 only, so you will
have to check with LAT and/or `lundump.c`.  

Snooping around in the bytecode
-------------------------------

This document is accompanied by two module files: `vm52.lua` and
`bytecode.lua`.  From the first, we use only `numberAt` at this
stage.  This function converts a four-byte substring to a 32-bit 
number, taking into account the endian-ness of the host system. 
We know from the above that a Lua 5.2 dumped function has the 
varargs flag at 28, the register count at 29, and the instruction count 
at position 30, followed by that many four-byte instructions. 

So let us take a look.

~~~
$ lua -l vm52
Lua 5.2.1  Copyright (C) 1994-2012 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
   func = load 'local  hello = "Hello" print (hello.." World!")'
   chunk = string.dump(func)

   function hasvarargs(chunk) return chunk:sub(28,28):byte()>0 end
   function nstack(chunk) return chunk:sub(29,29):byte() end
   function ninstr(chunk) return vm52.numberAt(chunk,30) end
   function instr(chunk,i) return vm52.numberAt(chunk:sub(30+4*i,33+4*i)) end

   ns = nstack(chunk)
   print ("This function" ..
     (hasvarargs(chunk) and " has a variable number of arguments and" or "") ..
     " uses "..ns.." register"..(ns~=1 and "s" or ""))

   for i=1,ninstr(chunk) do
      print(string.format("%08X",instr(chunk,i)))
   end 
00000001
00404046
00000080
000080C1
0100C096
0100405D
0080001F
~~~

You can see the bytes of the bytecode file, reversed because my
machine is little-endian.

The module file `vm52.lua` has more than just `numberAt`: it has
the four functions I defined in the above code, and more important, 
it has `assemble` and `disassemble`. The latter does much the same
as `luac -l` does when given dumped bytecode.  Following on the previous
Lua session,

~~~
   for i=1,vm52.ninstr(code) do
      print(vm52.disassemble(vm52.instr(code,i)))
   end 
LOADK 0 -1
GETTABUP 1 0 -2
MOVE 2 0
LOADK 3 -3
CONCAT 2 2 3
CALL 1 2 1
RETURN 0 1
~~~

Instruction anatomy
-------------------

The above hex listing corresponds exactly with the bytecode file, 
except that the bytes are reversed.  This is a consequence of
the little endian-ness of my system:  little-endian byte order 
is really hard to read when you work with 32-bit numbers, given 
that bytes are universally coded with big-endian bits. 

So the instruction bytes need to be reversed before we decompose 
them into bits and display them. The `numberAt` function does that 
if necessary.  

As we have seen, the instructions are:

~~~
00 00 00 01   LOADK 0 -1
00 40 40 46   GETTABUP 1 0 -2
00 00 00 80   MOVE 2 0
00 00 80 c1   LOADK 3 -3
01 00 c0 96   CONCAT 2 2 3
01 00 40 5d   CALL 1 2 1
00 80 00 1f   RETURN 0 1
~~~~

We now expand the bytes into bits and group them.  If `lopcodes.c`
says the instruction has mode `iABC`, we group the bits as (9,9,8,6),
defining the values `B`,`C`,`A`,`OP`; if it says `iABx` or `iAsBx`,
as (18,8,6), defining the values `Bx`,`A`,`OP` or `sBx`,`A`,`OP`;
if it says `iAx`, as (26,6), defining the values `Ax`,`OP`.

~~~

In the above table, the bits are numbered left to right as 31, 30,
…, 0.  The notation "0+6" means the 6 bits with low-order bit (rightmost
in the above table) at position 0.  If the instruction is stored
as a Lua number, these bits are given by `bit32:extract(0,6)`.

1.  `OP` is the opcode, at 0+6 (see below).
2.  `A` is the first operand in all instructions, at 6:8, treated as an
    unsigned number. Its maximum value is 255.
3.  `B` is the second operand in instructions with mode `iABC`, at 23+9,
    treated as a signed number. The actual instruction does not always
    use `B`.

    The first bit is the sign bit. If this is 1, the other eight bits
    encode one less than the absolute value of `B`. Thus there is no
    -0, the minimum value of `B` is -256 and its maximum value is 255.
4.  `C` is the third operand in instructions with mode `iABC`, at 14+9,
    treated as a signed number like `B`. The actual instruction does not
    always use `C`.
5.  `Bx` is the second operand in instructions with mode `iABx`, at
    14+18, treated as a 19-bit signed number like `B` but not storing
    the sign bit since `Bx` is always negative.
6.  `sBx` means "`Bx` treated as an 18-bit signed number."
7.  `Ax` is the only operand in instructions with mode `iAx`, at 6+26,
    treated like `Bx` (27-bit signed number, always negative, sign bit
    not stored). 

The opcodes and a brief description of what the instructions do
are given as an `enum` in `lopcodes.h`.  We have grouped them 
in groups of related functionality.  The description (taken verbatim
from `lopcodes.h`) uses the following notation, in which `B`, `Bx` etc
refer not to numbers encoded in bits, but to the numbers visible in
the disassembly shown by `luac`.

`R(A)`, `R(B)`, `R(C)`
~   The register numbered `A`, `B` or `C`.
`Kst(Bx)`
~   The constant numbered `|Bx|.`
`KPROTO[Bx]`
~   The function prototype numbered `|Bx|`.
`RK(B)`, `RK(C)`
~   The register numbered `B` or `C`; if `B` or `C` is negative, 
    the constant numbered `|B|` or `|C|`.
`FPF`
~   Fields per flush. Read NFI's explanation.
`UpValue[B]`
~   The upvalue numbered `B`.
`pc`
~   Program counter: which instruction will be executed next.
`closure`
~   Make a closure (function plus upvalues).

### Notes

Taken nearly verbatim from `lopcodes.h`.

- In CALL, if (`B == 0`) then `B = top`. If (`C == 0`), then `top` is
  set to `last_result+1`, so next open instruction (CALL, RETURN,
  SETLIST) may use `top`.

- In VARARG, if (`B == 0`) then use actual number of varargs and
  set top (like in CALL with `C == 0`).

- In RETURN, if (`B == 0`) then return up to `top`.

- In SETLIST, if (`B == 0`) then `B = `top`; if (`C == 0`) then next
  'instruction' is EXTRAARG(real C).

- In LOADKX, the next 'instruction' is always EXTRAARG.

- For comparisons, A specifies what condition the test should accept
  (true or false).

- All 'skips' (`pc++`) assume that next instruction is a jump.

Very brief remarks on VM5.2 
---------------------------

> A little learning is a dangerous thing.  
> Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring. 

Those well-known words of Alexander Pope serve as a warning here.
 
You should really read NFI first and treat this section as a mere
summary of the points needed to understand the rest of this
document.  Actually, it contains only the stuff I had to look
up for myself after reading the description of the operations
above, so it may be a good idea to re-read that before continuing.

I found it helpful to disassemble short snippets of Lua code
and figure out why the VM instructions achieve the desired result.
For example:

~~~
$ lua -l vm52
   src = "local x, y = ...; return x+y, ..."
   chunk = string.dump(load(src))   
   for i=1,vm52.ninstr(chunk) do
      print(vm52.disassemble(vm52.instr(chunk,i)))
   end
VARARG 0 3
ADD 2 0 1
VARARG 3 0
RETURN 2 0
RETURN 0 1 
~~~

`VARARG 0 3`
~   Load the first (3-1) arguments from the vararg list into consecutive
    registers starting at register 0.
`ADD 2 0 1`
~   Add registers 0 and 1, storing the result in register 2.
`VARARG 3 0`
~   Load all of the vararg list into consecutive registers starting
    at register 3.
`RETURN 2 0`
~   Return everything from register 2 to the stack top.
`RETURN 0 1`
~   Lua can't be sure in general that there is no condition branch
    skipping the preceding return statement and always inserts another 
    return statement for good measure.

The C API of Lua does everything on a virtual stack.  Seen in a certain 
way, the virtual machine is merely an interface to the API, providing 
a layer of abstraction between Lua source code and the API. However,
the VM has access to the private fields of a `lua_State`, whereas the 
C API works entirely via the documented routines.

The Virtual Machine itself is not stack-based.  It is allowed exclusive 
use of a portion of the stack called its _frame_, but within that 
frame, the VM works with constant register numbers: there is no pushing
and popping. An important difference in usage is that negative indices 
don't mean the same as in the C API.  They refer to constants stored
elsewhere, not in the stack frame.

The VM can access items on other active stack frames that have
been provided as the upvalues.

Local variables are aliases for registers. The `luac` listing grabs
their names from the debugging information, but instruction disassembly
by itself cannot do that.  There is no overhead involved in creating 
them.

That's it for now
-----------------

When I have time and inclination to add more, I'll do so.
Please send corrections and comments. If I am still active and about,
you will find me on `lua-l`.
